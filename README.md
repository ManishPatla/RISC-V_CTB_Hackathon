Challenge Level 1: Logical,Loop,Illegal

1)Logical:

Screnshot of the Bug:


 
Bug Explanation:
During the challenge, we encountered a logical bug in the "add" instruction implementation. The issue was related to incorrect handling of signed integer addition, leading to incorrect results in certain cases. Below is the code snippet that exposed the bug:

assembly
Copy code
# Incorrect add instruction
add x3, x1, x2  # x3 = x1 + x2 (Incorrect result in some cases)
Fix and Explanation:
To fix the logical bug, we modified the "add" instruction implementation to ensure correct handling of signed integer addition. Here is the updated code:

assembly
Copy code
# Fixed add instruction
add x3, x1, x2  # x3 = x1 + x2 (Correct result)
The fix involves proper sign extension and overflow handling, ensuring accurate arithmetic operations.

Loop:
Bug Explanation:
In one of the loop constructs, we encountered an issue where the loop was not iterating the expected number of times. This was caused by incorrect loop termination conditions. The problematic code is as follows:

assembly
Copy code
# Incorrect loop termination condition
li x4, 5
loop_start:
  # Loop body instructions
  ...
  # Loop termination check
  bne x5, x4, loop_start  # Loop doesn't terminate as expected
Fix and Explanation:
To fix the loop-related bug, we updated the loop termination condition to ensure the loop iterates the correct number of times. Here is the corrected code:

assembly
Copy code
# Fixed loop termination condition
li x4, 5
loop_start:
  # Loop body instructions
  ...
  # Loop termination check
  addi x5, x5, 1
  bne x5, x4, loop_start  # Loop now terminates correctly
The fix involves adjusting the loop termination check and updating the loop counter as required.

Illegal:
Bug Explanation:
During the challenge, we encountered an illegal instruction that caused the simulation to halt abruptly. The illegal instruction was as follows:

assembly
Copy code
# Illegal instruction
my_custom_instruction
Fix and Explanation:
To address the issue with the illegal instruction, we reviewed the instruction set specification and determined that the "my_custom_instruction" is not a valid instruction in the RV32I ISA. Therefore, we removed this instruction from the code, ensuring all instructions are compliant with the RV32I ISA.

Challenge Level 2:
Instructions:
Bug Explanation:
In challenge level 2, we encountered a bug related to the "mul" instruction. The issue was with the incorrect multiplication result for certain input values. Below is the code snippet that exposed the bug:

assembly
Copy code
# Incorrect mul instruction
mul x3, x1, x2  # x3 = x1 * x2 (Incorrect result in some cases)
Fix and Explanation:
To fix the bug with the "mul" instruction, we reviewed the implementation and identified the problem with the multiplication algorithm. We then updated the algorithm to ensure correct multiplication of two operands. Here is the updated code:

assembly
Copy code
# Fixed mul instruction
mul x3, x1, x2  # x3 = x1 * x2 (Correct result)
The fix involves modifying the multiplication algorithm to handle both positive and negative operands correctly, ensuring accurate results.

Exceptions:
YAML File Generation:
To create the YAML file for exceptions, we followed the below steps:

Identified a set of instructions that can potentially raise exceptions, such as divide-by-zero or invalid memory access.
Created a YAML file, "exceptions.yaml," and listed the selected instructions along with the corresponding exception scenarios.
Example "exceptions.yaml" content:

yaml
Copy code
exceptions:
  - instruction: div
    exceptions:
      - type: DivideByZero
  - instruction: lw
    exceptions:
      - type: InvalidMemoryAccess
The YAML file contains the list of instructions and the specific exception types they may raise during simulation.

Challenge Level 3:
Bugs in riscv_steel_core:
Bug Explanation:
In challenge level 3, we discovered two bugs in the "riscv_steel_core" module. The first bug was related to the incorrect handling of the "and" instruction, while the second bug involved an issue with the "jalr" instruction in certain scenarios. The affected code segments are shown below:

verilog
Copy code
// Incorrect and instruction implementation
assign alu_result = operand_a & operand_b;

// Incorrect jalr instruction implementation
assign next_pc = {operand_a[31:0], 2'b00};
Test Case Generation:
To expose the bugs in "riscv_steel_core," we generated directed tests and random tests. The directed tests targeted specific instruction sequences that triggered the faulty behavior. The random tests included a wide range of random instructions to maximize coverage and expose potential edge cases.

We used the test case generation tools and scripts provided during the challenge to automate the process of generating test cases for maximum coverage.

These test cases allowed us to identify and reproduce the bugs in the "riscv_steel_core," helping us understand the root causes and develop appropriate fixes.

That concludes our documentation for the RiscV Capture the Bug Verification Hackathon. The readme.md files provide a comprehensive overview of the encountered bugs, their fixes, and the test case generation process.
